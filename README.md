My project is an indie game that reflects the theme of a technological utopia. The player moves through a futuristic world, collecting stars. I wanted the gameplay to be as simple as possible to support the utopian atmosphere. My inspiration came from the song “МКСЗ” (The boy who gathered stars) by the russian band Созвездие Отрезок (https://open.spotify.com/track/1PZ2t7Sh0kEVwKx9LarVAR?si=5eb7d5d4340545c1).
I drew the boy character model myself, while the satellites were taken from open-source stock images. The font was downloaded from https://www.fontspace.com.
For research on making games in p5.js, I used tutorials from the official website, videos from Jason Erdreich (https://www.youtube.com/@MrErdreich), JSLegendDev (https://www.youtube.com/@JSLegendDev), and open discussions about JavaScript coding on Reddit.
At first, I made a simple template where the character — a basic square — reacted to the left and right arrow keys. Then I added stars, a score counter, and a simple background. After that, I started loading external files, replaced the square with a boy character, added a “rare star,” music, and other elements. I also had to add a loading screen, because without it the game took too long to load and could work incorrectly.
